# Redis Secret (base)
#
# This Secret contains the Redis password used by the server and clients.
# The base contains a placeholder value so overlays can replace or patch
# it with environment-specific credentials (for example, External Secrets
# or CI/CD secret injection).
#
# Keys in this Secret:
# - `password`: raw password string used by init scripts, env vars, and clients.
#
# Important: Do NOT commit production secrets to the repo. Replace this
# placeholder in overlays with a secure secret management workflow.
