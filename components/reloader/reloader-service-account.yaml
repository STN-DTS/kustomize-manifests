# RELOADER SERVICEACCOUNT
#
# Dedicated ServiceAccount for the Reloader controller with minimal privileges.
# This ServiceAccount is bound to the reloader-role via RoleBinding, granting
# only the necessary permissions for configuration watching and workload updates.
# Running with a dedicated ServiceAccount follows security best practices.
